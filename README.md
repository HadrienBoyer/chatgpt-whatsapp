# whatsapp-gpt

  - You'll need to run WhatsApp from a phone number, using the Golang lib "whats-meow".
    - You'll run a dedicated browser in another window that's controlling ChatGPT.
  - Open two terminals in your favorite IDE (I am using GoLand), or from your OS,
    then run these two commands: 
       - `go run main.go`
       - `python server.py`. I am extremely doubtful they will work for you on the first run.
       - You can also try `multichat.py` if you want to watch two ChatGPTs talk to each other.
